"Notes"
"For 2020, the majority of our health coverage topics are based on analysis of the Census Bureau’s March Supplement to the Current Population Survey (the CPS Annual Social and Economic Supplement or ASEC). Previously, our source for these data was the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS); however, release of the 2020 ACS data was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. We will continue to report data from the ACS for 2021 and later. Although health coverage and population estimates using ACS are still available for years excluding 2020, the 2020 and 2021 data from CPS cannot be compared to prior year estimates from ACS. Due to known data quality issues with the 2019 CPS ASEC data, which was collected in March 2020 just at the onset of the pandemic and experienced low response rates, we have chosen not to report the 2019 CPS data. We provide trend data for 2016, 2018, 2020 and 2021 using the CPS."
